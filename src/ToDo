-Create pyramid depth images or table
However, there are techniques that allow you to modify or generate depth values indirectly.
Here are a few approaches:

    Depth Pre-Pass: You can perform a separate rendering pass called a depth pre-pass,
    where you render the scene with simplified shaders that only write to the depth attachment.
    This technique can be used for various purposes, such as generating depth maps for shadow
    mapping or depth-based effects.

    Compute Shader: You can use a compute shader to perform calculations and generate depth values.
    In this case, you would typically use a separate image or buffer as the output, and then
    transfer the computed depth values to a depth image if needed.

    Depth Reconstruction: If you have access to additional information, such as position or
    depth maps from previous frames, you can use techniques like depth reconstruction to generate
    or refine depth values based on these inputs. This can be useful for applications like
    depth-based upscaling or post-processing effects.
